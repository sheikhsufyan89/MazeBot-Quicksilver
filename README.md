## MazeBot-Quicksilver

Quicksilver is a precision-driven wall-following robot designed for smooth navigation and accurate turns. Equipped with ultrasonic sensors, it continuously measures distances from surrounding walls to maintain a fixed distance while moving. The robot features Tiva-C (EK-TM4C123GXL) as the microcontroller, brushed DC motors for precise motion, and an L298N motor driver for efficient control. The robot is programmed in C language using Keil ÂµVision 5.

Its compact **18.5 cm x 11 cm** design, with a dual-wheel drive system and free-moving support wheels, ensures stability and maneuverability. Ideal for maze-solving, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous navigation tasks. ðŸš€
